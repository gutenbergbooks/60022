<p>To all surviving saloon passengers
of the good ship Lithia, who
have rounded the Horn and passed
through perilous Beering Straits,
and suffered shipwreck, shock, and
sudden thirst: to those intrepid
souls who have clung to the slippery
hull of the Water Wagon when it
seemed the gallant craft could
not live another hour; who, lashed
to the sprinkler, have ridden out
many a choking dust-storm; who
have heard the cafe Lorelei sing,
and still hung on, deaf to her seductive
song: <span class="nw">and—</span></p>

<p><a name="pg.010" id="pg.010" href="#pg.010"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>x<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>To the memory of countless
thousands lost at sea, swept into the
seething drink without a word of
warning, cut off in the blossoms of
their resolutions, and sent to their
slate accounts with all their imperfections
on their <span class="nw">heads—</span></p>

<p>This little volume is affectionately
dedicated.</p>

 />EDITORS’ NOTE</h3>


<p>The Log of the Water Wagon
was compiled from memoranda
found in a floating milk-bottle with
a patent stopper, flung overboard
just before the good ship “Lithia”
foundered in a fearful simoom off
White Rock Point. The notes, pencilled
in a trembling hand, on the
backs of blank temperance pledges,
I O U’s, and wine-lists, were barely
<a name="pg.012" id="pg.012" href="#pg.012"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>xii<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>legible, testifying to the fearful condition
of the unknown writer’s
tongue, manifestly incapable of
moistening the pencil.</p>

<p>With the notes were enclosed a
Water Wagon folder, showing itinerary,
rules and regulations, points
of interest touched at, etc., a fragment
of a clipping from the New
York Sun, and sundry moral reflections
upon life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness.</p>

<p>The editors have preserved, as far
as possible, the spirit and literary
style of the Log-keeper, whose
identity is an interesting conjecture.
His fate, and that of his fellow
passengers, is shrouded in mystery.</p>

new white paint, her blue streamers snapping
in the breeze, loaded to the limit with
enthusiastic and babbling passengers, the
Water Wagon left last night on another
perilous voyage. A tremendous crowd was
present to see her off. The surging mass of
well-wishers included relatives and friends
of the passengers, a large delegation from
the International Federation of Mineral
Water Bottlers, and representatives from
the W. C. T. U., Band of Hope, Never
Again League, and other dusty associations.</p>

<p>The farewell presents to the passengers
were unusually numerous. These included
hot-water bags with “Bon Voyage” hand-painted
on them, silver bonbon boxes
containing soda mint and lithia tablets, individual
cut-glass bromo-seltzer bottles,
water lilies, watermelons, and other fruit
and flowers.</p>

<p>Just before the hour for sailing happy
little speeches were made by the Superintendent
of the Water Works, the Commissioner
of Irrigation, and the Hon. Bromo S.
Emerson, of Ballato, whose sizzling oratory
was received with terrific applause.</p>

<p>Promptly at midnight a bottle of sarsaparilla
was broken on the Lithia’s sprinkler,
the gang-hose was uncoupled and hauled
aboard, and the Water Wagon glided gracefully
away from her moorings.</p>

<p>A score or more of belated passengers
came straggling down the pier and finding</p>

<p>In making reservations, the passenger’s
real name, not the station-house
name, must be given, in full.
All “John Smiths” will be regarded
with suspicion, and must be satisfactorily
identified.</p>

<p>Seats as well as berths will be
assigned for the entire voyage.
For a few choice seats next the
water-cooler a small additional fee
will be asked.</p>

<p>No life-preservers will be found
in staterooms. Do not ask for them.</p>

<p>No “bundles” will be allowed in
staterooms, nor allowed to lie
around the decks.</p>

<p>Excellent concerts will be

 class="ns">[</span>17<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>rendered every evening in the main
saloon by the Band of Hope. A
select library will be found in the
smoking-room. Water-marked stationery
is also at the disposal of all
first-class passengers.</p>

<p>Don’t try to get on the Wagon
while it is in motion. It is the
Captain’s business to stop for loads.
If he does not stop when flagged,
you will know he is full.</p>

<p>When rounding the sharp curve
at the Pousse Cafe, passengers are
cautioned to hold fast.</p>

<p>Passengers feeling their anchors
dragging, and seized with a sudden
desire to leap from the Wagon,
should apply to purser for parachutes.</p>

<p>Stop-overs will be allowed at
Vichy Springs, Delaware Water
Gap, and Waterbury only.</p>

 </span></span></a>No transfers given on transfers.</p>

<p>Passengers losing any of their
wheels will find them in the wheel-house.</p>

<p>No rain-checks will be given out.
This is a dry cruise.</p>

<p>Buy a round-trip ticket and save
money.</p>

<p>All mail received en route will be
read aloud by the steward at sunset.</p>

<p>SPECIAL INFORMATION.—In
looking toward the bow of the
vessel, the left-hand side is port.
The right-hand is sherry.</p>

<p><small>NOTE.—The writer of this record, being
the only sober passenger aboard the Good
Ship “Lithia,” has been requested by the
Captain to keep the Log. The Captain
kindly explains that a log is a thing in
which you put down the daily occurrences
on board ship. I have kept a dog, and a
valet, and a thirst, and other things, but
a log is sure a new proposition. But, dash
my tarry toplights, here goes. Avast there,
my hearties! Yeo-heave-ho! Yo-ho!</small></p>

<p>At midnight we left the Bar, and

a case of malted milk for Moxie

Hennessy Martel called a mass-meeting

happened to the hydraulic engines,
and the Captain has given orders to
let go the dope-sheet.</p>

<p>Guinness Stout and the Count of
Maraschino had a hot argument over
the meaning of “load water line,”
the Count maintaining that there
was no such thing. They appealed
to the Captain, who told them they
were both wrong, and that A wins
the box of fudge.</p>

<p>In case of a fall from the Water
Wagon, prompt action will often
save the victim.</p>

<p>While the life-line is being cast
and the breeches-buoy rigged, lay
the sufferer on his back and spray
him thoroughly with a siphon of
carbonic until signs of consciousness
appear. In the majority of
cases his first words will be: “Make
mine a rye highball.” You will
then repeat the siphon treatment,
at the same time making a few
passes over him and reciting monotonously
in his ear: “Water, water
<a name="pg.047" id="pg.047" href="#pg.047"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>47<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>everywhere, and not a drop to
drink.”</p>

<p>Usually this will produce a condition
in which the breeches-buoy can
be quickly adjusted and the sufferer
hauled back on the Wagon. If it
fails, work his arms up and down
like pump-handles, and exclaim in
threatening tones: “Your wife is
coming back on the 5.03 train.” If
his eyes remain glazed and his
struggles continue, add harshly:
“She telegraphs that Mother is
coming with her.” Complete coma
should result. If not, it can be induced
by tactfully whispering:
“The next round is on the house.”
This has never failed.</p>

<p>The breeches-buoy may now be
attached and the sufferer snaked
<a name="pg.048" id="pg.048" href="#pg.048"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>48<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>aboard the Wagon and lashed to the
tank.</p>

<p>During his convalescence a friend
should be constantly at his side,
reading to him the history of the
Johnstown flood. A single chapter
has worked wonders.</p>

<p>The morning opened clear and
extra dry. Big head winds. The

sky was cloudy, so he took the

<p>The Steward, assisted by the
Ship’s Valet, dusted off the tongues
of the passengers and sprayed them
with Blisterine. They were very
<a name="pg.054" id="pg.054" href="#pg.054"><span class="pagenum"><span

<p>Spoke the brewery barge Budweiser,
outward bound, Captain
Umlaut. The Budweiser fired a
salute of four dozen bottles, not one
of which, unfortunately, reached the
Lithia’s deck. In a heroic effort to
rescue a bottle, Tom Collins fell
overboard. He was picked up by
a fishing party, and when last seen
was eating the bait.</p>

<p>The Scotch-plaid guinea-pig threw

<p>Turner Van Newleaf, one of the

<p>Some practical joker raised the

mix-up look like a procession of

Jim Rickey and Guinness Stout.</p>

<p>5 P. M.—Sighted the Players’

<p>The drouth in the saloon is intolerable.
The dry batteries that
run the fans have given out. Count
Martini has tossed his waterproof
<a name="pg.059" id="pg.059" href="#pg.059"><span class="pagenum"><span

is such a thing as being too dry.
The sentiment was wildly applauded.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>Eggley Monade has been going
around asking the conundrum,
“Why is a port-hole like a chaser?”
Everybody gave it up, and he borrowed
the Captain’s megaphone to
reply, “Because it’s something on
the side.” The Mate put a crimp in
him with a belaying-pin, and Doctor
Zoolak thinks that will hold him for
awhile.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"

<p>At 5.30 P. M. we made Larchmont.
The club-house piazza was
<a name="pg.060" id="pg.060" href="#pg.060"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>60<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>crowded with gold braid, yachting-caps,
and booze. Wigwagged that
we were the Good Ship Lithia, and
they signalled back, “Look out for
floating mines.” Most of the club
members grabbed their drinks and
fled to the cyclone cellars, but the
daredevils of the rocking-chair
fleet sat tight and jeered at us.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>The Lithia’s decks have been

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"

<p>The Larchmont Commodore has

 </span></span></a>Our Captain, alive to the critical
situation, has jammed the wheel
hard over and given the enemy a
broadside of lithia tablets. The
Highball has reversed her engines
and is heading for the dry-dock.
Her hull looks like a half-portion

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"

<p>The Larchmont Commodore wirelessed
to the Millionaire Volunteer
Fire Department, which made a
record run. They have hooked on
to the club’s fire-water plug, and
are battering us with a two-inch
stream of Glengarry Scotch. We
<a name="pg.062" id="pg.062" href="#pg.062"><span class="pagenum"><span

pop.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"

<p>The Fire Department has uncoupled,
and hooked on to a tank
of club cocktails. The deadly stream
is burning off the Lithia’s paint.</p>

<p>Our passengers, led by Hennessy

<p>Our gallant Captain looped the
Santiago loop and is raking the
enemy fore and aft with withering
broadsides of moxie. Some of the
stuff got into the drinks of the rocking-chair
fleet on the club-house
piazza, and the loss of life was appalling.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"

<p>The enemy, completely demoralized,

<p>The Water Wagon is a ball-bearing,
clipper-built craft of the whale-back
type, designed by Mac Nesia,
and built in Bath, Me. She draws
more water than a yacht-club barkeep,
and her water-line is eighteen
glasses and a pony, with plenty of
hang-over. The Water Wagon is
equipped with Saratoga springs,
which ensure a minimum of jolt, and
a complete battery of hydraulic dust-pumps.</p>

<p>All the staterooms are heated by
Hot Copper system and lighted by
carbonic acid gas. Don’t blow it out!</p>

<p>Accommodations on the Water
Wagon are unlimited. There is
always room for one or two more.</p>

at a pirate or two.</p>

<p>Entered the channel, with Trinity
cliffs astern. Pilot Lawson is at the
wheel, looking very wise. Everybody’s
watching him.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>An indignation meeting has been
called on the two-for-a-quarter deck
by excited passengers who promised
their wives, sweethearts, and parents
<a name="pg.099" id="pg.099" href="#pg.099"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>99<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to keep out of Wall Street. They
demand that the vessel be put back.
The Pilot remarked, grimly, that it
is harder to get out of Wall Street
than into it. He advises all hands
to hang on and wait for a rise.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>A little before 3 P. M. the
lookout shouted, “Maelstrom dead
ahead!” A panic resulted, and the
cry went up that Lawson was a
bum pilot. Strong and willing hands
tore him from the wheel, and, pursued
by the infuriated passengers
and crew, he ran down the deck and
dove over the taffrail, yawping: “I
will have something to say next
month!”</p>

 </span></span></a>“We are lost!” the Captain
shouted, as he staggered down the
stairs. Putting three chips on the
red, he spun the wheel to starboard.
Round and round in the clutches
of the maelstrom spun the good
ship Lithia. “Whee!” cried Hennessy
Martel, “this is like old
times. First good whirl my head’s
had since the Lambs’ Club gambol.”</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>2.56 P. M.—The Lithia seems
hopelessly lost. The passengers,
with blanched faces, are swapping
farewells and keepsakes.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>2.58 P. M.—Gottlieb Kirschwasser,
<a name="pg.101" id="pg.101" href="#pg.101"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>101<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of Milwaukee, lost his head,
(the one he came aboard with), and,
screaming, “Heute rot, Morgen tot!
Auf wiedersehen!” hurled himself
overboard.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>3 P.M.—Saved! The Stock Exchange
bell struck three, and the
maelstrom knocked off for the day.
The Lithia’s passengers joyfully returned
to one another the keepsakes
and farewells, and Kirschwasser was
fished out of the drink with a boat-hook
and put in the boiler-room to
dry.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>4 P. M.—We have left Wall
Street, and are bowling along toward
<a name="pg.102" id="pg.102" href="#pg.102"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>102<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>White Rock Point, and kicking up
an awful dust.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>The drouth has become intolerable,
and the sufferings of the passengers
are increasing hourly. The
deck-planks are curling up, and the
oakum is oozing from the seams.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>The barometer exploded with a
loud pop, and Hennessy Martel,
wild-eyed, ran up the main hatch,
crying, “Is that George Kessler
opening wine?” “No such luck,”
gurgled Tom Ginn, who was spraying
his throat with Blisterine.</p>

 </span></span></a>Old Medford, the Water Wagon
veteran, says he doesn’t remember
a voyage attended by so many disasters.
“We must get rid of the
Jonah,” said he.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>4.44 P. M.—The Captain made a
neat little speech from the bridge,
and presented to each passenger a
dry-point picture of the good ship
Lithia. Most of them were flung
overboard.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>After supper the Captain, a most
considerate man, gave a smoker, in
order to take the minds of the passengers
off their fearful thirst. A
<a name="pg.104" id="pg.104" href="#pg.104"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>104<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Keith circuit top-liner, who has a
whole page and his picture in
“Who’s Who on the Water Wagon,”
gave an imitation of an actor refusing
a drink. The audience overlooked
the screaming absurdity of
the plot in their admiration for the
artistic performance.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>Professor Argus, the mind wizard,
offered to read the minds of all the
audience at one crack. Challenged
to perform this astounding feat, the
Professor smiled and said, “You are
all thinking that it is almost time
for a long cold highball.” Crackling
shouts of admiration came from
<a name="pg.105" id="pg.105" href="#pg.105"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>105<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the parched throats of the audience,
and the protest, “Fake! Fake!
Somebody must have told you!”</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>Harvey Steele, a floor-walker in a
wholesale anchor house, was the
next entertainer. He gave a realistic
imitation of a crooked barkeep playing
on an upright cash register.
When he finished the audience declared
there was nothing in it.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>An amateur hypnotist was the
next to oblige. “Will some gentleman
kindly step up and assist the
<a name="pg.106" id="pg.106" href="#pg.106"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>106<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Professor in this demonstration?”
he requested. Dead silence; nobody
made a move. The Professor smiled
patiently, and repeated his request;
no takers. Finally the Captain, who
had drifted in, stepped up, remarking,
“Try your stunt on me, Professor.”
(Deafening applause.) The
amateur hypnotist took the Captain
in hand and made a few passes at
him, and he took the count in six
seconds. “Happy man!” cried the
Professor, fixing the subject with his
glittering eye. “Happy man! you
are soused for fair, and are opening
vintage wine.” “Whee!” said the
Captain, bracing himself against
Davy Jones’s locker. “Frappe two
<a name="pg.107" id="pg.107" href="#pg.107"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>107<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>more quarts! Line up, boys!”
(Tumultuous applause, and cries of
“Don’t wake him up!”) But the
Professor did wake him up, and the
Captain bowed sheepishly and returned
to the wheel-house. “Will
some other gentleman kindly step
up?” asked the Amateur Hypnotist.
The scramble that followed made
the rush-hour at the Brooklyn
Bridge look like a chess tournament.
In the jam the Professor’s
shoulder was dislocated, putting him
out of business.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>When a gentleman is deposited
on his door-mat by a friendly copper,
like a cake of ice or a jar of
milk, his sense of humour is wonderfully
acute. To tip over an
aquarium of goldfish on his way
through the hall strikes him as the
height of the ridiculous, and the
flopping of the little fishes and turtles
on the Persian rug throws him
into spasms of stifled mirth. He
chuckles himself into hiccoughs
over his vain attempts to unlace his
shoes while lying on his back, and
his progress up-stairs on all fours is
<a name="pg.110" id="pg.110" href="#pg.110"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>110<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>accompanied by joyous giggles.
When he loses his equilibrium and
rolls back down-stairs, he sits up
and says: “God pity the men at
sea on a night like this!”</p>

<p>He is now serious. He turns on
all the electric lights and remarks,
censoriously: “Here it is broad
daylight, the front stoop unswept,
and not a soul in the house up.” In
this spirit of criticism he ascends to
his wife’s room, and, as she raises
her head from the pillow for one
comprehensive glance, he says,
sternly: “Things are going from
bad to worse in this house.”</p>

<p>To her icy rejoinder, “Is that
any reason why you should come
home in this condition?” he replies,
with unruffled importance: “The
kitchen fire is out; the canary hasn’t
<a name="pg.111" id="pg.111" href="#pg.111"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>111<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>been fed; the piano isn’t dusted;
and look at this!” He holds up a
ravelling. “Found it right in the
middle of the hall! What kind of
housekeeping do you call that?
Why, if I tried to run my business
that way, we’d all be in the poor-house.”</p>

<p>Softly and soothingly his spouse
returns: “Frank, if you’ll lay the
two goldfish on the bureau and
come to bed, we’ll have a long talk
about it in the morning.”</p>

<p>And they do.</p>

<p>The morning opened as still and
dry as Boston after 11 P. M. The
sun rose red as an auction flag
against a cold-gravy sky, and the
atmosphere is heavy with something
doing. The Captain, solemn as a
night-clerk in a Raines Law hotel,
is at the wheel, and the Lookout is
pop-eyed. A few insomniacal passengers
are pacing the deck like a
man who has been called for margin,
and are bothering the Captain
with fool questions. The Captain
has put on a pair of plush ear-muffs.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>11 A. M.—Dirty weather ahead.
The Lithia is logging her limit, in
<a name="pg.116" id="pg.116" href="#pg.116"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>116<span class="ns">]

  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>11.20 A. M.—The Lookout reports
a siphon-shaped cloud off the
weather bow. The air is laden with
dust, and is coming in dry hot puffs.
Tom Ginn thinks we are running
into another automobile party, but
Old Medford says we are up against
worse than that.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>11.30 A. M.—The wind has risen
to half a gale, and the dust is settling
on the Lithia’s decks like the
soot from a smoking nickel-plated
<a name="pg.117" id="pg.117" href="#pg.117"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>117<span class="ns">]

anything.</p>

<p>Gottlieb Kirschwasser has just
made his will, bequeathing his collection

deserting the ship.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>A tidal wave of dust swept over
us, carrying away the life-boat and
<a name="pg.118" id="pg.118" href="#pg.118"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>118<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Kirschwasser’s meerschaum pipe

Kirschwasser says he won it at a

<p>The Steward has distributed auto

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"

<p>The Captain has turned the wheel
over to the Mate, and has gone
among the passengers, striving to reassure
them. It seems we are off
<a name="pg.119" id="pg.119" href="#pg.119"><span class="pagenum"><span

<p>The sufferings of the passengers
baffle description. Everybody feels
that this is his last trip on the
Wagon. Hennessy Martel has
tied another string around his
thumb, to remind himself to make
it two drinks when he gets off.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>Old Medford, who is as mad as
a conductor when you give him five
pennies, insists that the Jonah be
dumped overboard. A dogged,
<a name="pg.120" id="pg.120" href="#pg.120"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>120<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>determined committee has gone below
to yank out Moxie Grandpa, who,
as old Medford says, is an interloper,
anyway, and has no more
business on the Water Wagon than
a trousers stretcher in a young
ladies’ seminary.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>Later.—Old Matzoon has been
dragged up from the hold, kicking
and clawing, and the passengers are
balloting on the proper disposition
of him.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>While the ballot was being taken,
another tidal wave of dust broke
<a name="pg.121" id="pg.121" href="#pg.121"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>121<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>over the hapless Lithia, and the
enraged passengers and crew cried
in chorus, “Over with the Jonah!”
The wretched Moxie fiend was thereupon
flung into the trailer, despite
the protests of the magenta elephant
and the Scotch-plaid guinea-pig.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>At 1.20 P. M. the Lithia grounded
with a fearful crash, and the billows
of dust that broke over her carried
away the sprinkler and all the spokes
in the aft wheel. A composite picture
of John B. Gough and Carrie
Nation fell to the cabin floor and
was totally wrecked.</p>

 </span></span></a>Buried in dust from deck to
trucks, the Lithia lay on her side,
pounding like a farmer at Coney
Island on a “Try Your Strength”
machine. The good old Wagon was
doomed. Nothing could hold in
such a simoom.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>The Captain shouted down-wind,
“Cut away the trailer!” The ship’s
Carpenter, with hammer and cold-chisel,
severed the tow-line, and the
menagerie vanished in the dust.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>At 1.35 the Lithia sprung a bunch
of leaks, and every drop of water
<a name="pg.123" id="pg.123" href="#pg.123"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>123<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>ran out of her. We are now high
and horribly dry. Hennessy Martel
has tied still another string around
his thumb, to remind himself to
make it three drinks when he gets
off. His hand is beginning to look
like a hammock.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>At 1.50 P. M. orders were given to
lighten ship. We threw over ten
bales of temperance pledges, fifty
cases malted milk, thirty-two cases
sarsaparilla, eighteen carboys root
beer, twenty-seven vats lemon soda,
two hundred and thirty-five gallons
mineral water, the library,
the band, the cash register, seventy-five
<a name="pg.124" id="pg.124" href="#pg.124"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>124<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>bundles of blue ribbons, the
water-cooler and three tons of
cracked ice, the pianola, Gottlieb
Kirschwasser, and Doctor Zoolak.
The Lithia righted, and it looks as
if the gallant craft will ride it out.
Cheers are rattling from the warped
throats of passengers and crew.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"
  width="63" height="36" /></p>

<p>2 P. M.—We are lost! A fresh
consignment of boarding-house carpets
has just been thrown under the
slapsticks at the Cleaning Works.
This is the limit of dirty weather.</p>

<p class="deco"><img src="images/decoration1.png" title="" alt="&#x1F660;&#x1F662;"

<p>The St. Bernard has leaped

<p>Hennessy Martel is maudlin and

“In case you pull through, old

<p>2.20 P. M.—We have launched
the life-raft, and stocked it hastily
with the following supplies: One
case Jack Spratt’s assorted dog biscuits,
two dozen golf balls, a crate
of sponges, two telephone books,
one “Little Giant” gas-stove, one
“Little Gem” safety lawn-mower,
